Analyzing Animal(mice) Study Datasets for a Pharmaceutical Company, to Identify and Visualize the Success of Treatment Regimens for Squamous Cell Carcinoma(SCC):

Tasks:
- Data Preparation.
- Generate Summary Statistics.
- Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts.
- Calculate Quartiles, find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot.
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculate correlation and regression.

FINAL ANALYSIS:
Upon scrutinizing the data, it seems that the drug regimen of Capomulin exhibits potential as an effective treatment for Squamous Cell Carcinoma in mice. Notably, in the observation of a specific mouse, a significant alteration in tumor volume was noted after the 20th day of treatment. While this suggests the efficacy of Capomulin in cancer treatment, it is imperative to analyze more data before making any definitive conclusions.

Furthermore, the data implies that weight may influence tumor volume in mice. For instance, among mice subjected to the Capomulin regimen, those with greater weight tended to have larger tumor volumes, while those with lower weight exhibited smaller tumors. This finding holds significance, especially if the end goal is to extrapolate our observations to humans and the treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Similar results in human data could potentially contribute to preventing or mitigating the occurrence of this cancer.
